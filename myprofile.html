        <h2>Background</h2>
        <article>
        <p>I grew up looking up to a father and older siblings, who were engineers by profession. That was my early inspiration to
        be an electrical engineer. It was everything but unfortunate that I was forced to study education to teach physics in
        college; a poor country’s government coercing students in the name of ‘policy’. That was something that did not align
        with my childhood plan. I ended up teaching physics for high school students.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Early Experience with IT</h2>
        <p>I then joined one of the top CS schools in Ethiopia. The financial hurdle was not easy to overcome with the meager
        payment I used to receive as a teacher. I dropped out of the school. My journey then followed a different route into the
        nonprofit world and assumed many different roles for about 8 years. I am grateful for the opportunities and career paths
        that I took in the nonprofit organizations that I worked in.</p>
       
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Journey</h2>
        <p>I moved to the US four years ago. I finished my graduate studies in Christian education. I started working for a
        nonprofit in Washington DC as a research fellow. But by of the end of 2018, I realized that I need to move to the tech
        world if I want a secure, good paying career. That was a huge adjustment in mindset and plans.
        I did not hesitate to join a coding bootcamp and took up to intermediate Web development in Html, CSS, and JavaScript. I
        was very fascinated about the capabilities of the new technologies and that opened my eyes that should be a serious
        consideration to stay viable and relevant in the job market in the coming decades.
        That decision motivated me to self-educated on different technologies and showed me the wide opportunities to work in
        tech and what I can do with what I learned. I even took the initiative to pay for very short-term trainings to further
        gain my programing skills.
        Further reflection & decision brought me to MIU. I hope to make the best out of my stay academic and career wise by
        being employed in educational technology world upon graduation.
